The Agressive enemy just patrols until it sees the player. Once it sees it, it will chase you until he or you dies.

The Passive enemy is a civiilian explorer ship, and will patrol and then flee upon sight of the player.

The Bounty enemy spawns once the player's bounty level exceeds a certain amount, and it knows where the player is at all times and will hunt until either one dies.
